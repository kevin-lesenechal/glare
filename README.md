# GLARE: OpenGL, (A) Rendering Engine #

The GLARE (`libglare`) is a simple, lightweight rendering engine built over
modern OpenGL (3.3+). It is written in C++17, and aimed to be multiplatform
(see below).

This project is highly experimental and just started recently: it is absolutely
not stable, not yet documented, and not ported to anything else than GNU/Linux.
